Durstpanzer II is a discord-bot for the German WarThunder squadron üçªDurstüçª.

## General Information

### About the bot

The bot is based on discord.js and runs on version 13.
> **Warning:**
> The bot won't work if you use other discord.js versions than 13.
> If you still want to use other versions, you need to migrate your code!

Durstpanzer II is build to help the squadron leaders to organize the squadron.

### About the squadron

We are a German WarThunder squadron for people of all ages. We are _not_ a tryhard squadron, although we always try to play squadron-battles for fun.

If you want to join us feel free to meet us on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/ecZR7WxMPt).

## Config

Place your secrets into `.env` like this:

```env

Place your options into `config.json` like this:
