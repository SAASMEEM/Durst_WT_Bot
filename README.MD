Durstpanzer II is a discord-bot for the german WarThunder squadron üçªDurstüçª.

## General Information

### About the bot

The bot is based on discord.js and runs on version 13.

Durstpanzer II can track down the time spent by all users in voice-channels.

### About the squadron

We are a german WarThunder squadron for people of all ages. We are _not_ a tryhard squadron, although we always try to play squadron-battles for fun.

If you want to join us feel free to meet us on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/ecZR7WxMPt).

## Config

Place your secrets and options into `config.json` like so:

```json
{
	"token": "<Your discord secret bot token goes here>",
	"mongoPass": "<Your mongo database instance location goes here. Usually starts with 'mongodb://your-domain'>",
	"adminId": "<Your discord id goes here>"
}
```


Also, you may change the `clientId` and `guildId` in `deploy-commands.js`:

Then run `node deploy-commands.js` to deploy slash-commands to your server.

> **Warning:**  
> The bot is still littered with magic strings and IDs. Especially the [officer role](https://github.com/SAASMEEM/Durst_WT_Bot#offizier) is still hard coded everywhere.  
> Also, there is a role mentioned by the `clanwar` command, which may be changed:
